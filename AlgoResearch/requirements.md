# Requirements for assignment 

## Introduction

Studying well-known algorithms at an advanced level is a multifaceted process requiring a deep
understanding of theory and practice. It can lead to a deeper appreciation of the algorithm’s
elegance and utility and may inspire you to contribute to its improvement or application in novel
ways. So, in this assignment, each group has to choose from 1-3 algorithms from the following list:

   Machine Learning and Top 10 Algorithms Everyone Should Know (oracle.com), 2018.

to study some advanced aspects of them as indicated below (the number of algorithms you choose
should depend on your team’s capability - no. of team members, your team competence, the difficulty
of the algorithms you choose, etc.) and fill in the form ??? by ???. You may select other algorithms
from other sources that fit your preferences, but you need my approval before you do your
assignment; please indicate this in Column F of the form above if this is the case.

## Technical report

Write a technical report in as detail as possible in English by LaTeX (see template at
[https://www.overleaf.com/read/gfwjzgtfbxmz], but you may use other templates at
[https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/report]). This technical report should address the
following aspects:

1.    Introduction:

- Begin with a thorough understanding of the algorithm’s purpose, history, and the problem it aims
to solve.

- Identify the algorithm’s key characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses.

2.    Backgrounds:

- Present the mathematical foundations of the algorithm, including its formal definition and any
relevant equations or proofs.

- Present the math backgrounds for the algorithm’s complexity analysis, including time and space
complexity.

- Explore the data structures used within the algorithm and how they impact its performance.

- Understand why specific data structures were chosen and their trade-offs.

3.    The Algorithms:

- Present the algorithm with a description in steps, pseudocode, a flow chart, and a toy example.

- Identify the design paradigm(s) employed by the algorithm (e.g., divide and conquer, dynamic
programming, greedy algorithms, etc.) 

- Analyze how the chosen strategy contributes to the algorithm’s efficiency and correctness. 

- Investigate any optimization techniques applied to the algorithm, such as pruning, memorization,
or heuristics. Assess how these optimizations affect the algorithm’s behaviour (if any).



4.    Complexity Analysis and Proof of Correctness:

- Perform a detailed analysis of the algorithm’s time and space complexity. Consider best-case,
worst-case, and average-case scenarios.

- Understand the implications of complexity on practical use.

- Analyze its performance and adapt it as needed for specific use cases.

- Prove the correctness of the algorithm using mathematical induction, loop invariants, or other
formal methods.

- Explore corner and potential edge cases to ensure the algorithm behaves as expected.

5.    Implementations, Applications, and Case Studies:

- Implement the algorithm in your preferred programming language(s). DO NOT ADD THE CODE TO THE
REPORT.

- Explore different implementation techniques, trade-offs, and optimizations.

- Benchmark your implementations against other algorithms or existing libraries.

- Investigate real-world applications of algorithms in various fields such as computer science,
engineering, finance, and more to gain practical experience.

- Understand how the algorithm solves specific problems in these domains.

- Study case examples where the algorithm has been used to solve complex problems.

- Analyze the strategies and adaptations applied in these cases.

6.    Discussion and Conclusion:

- Explore advanced topics related to the algorithm, such as parallelization, distributed computing,
or hardware acceleration

- Discuss some recent research developments and improvements.

- Identify any open research problems or challenges related to the algorithm.

- Consider how advancements in the field could impact the algorithm’s future development.

- Compare the studied algorithm with other algorithms solving similar problems.

- Analyze the pros and cons of different approaches.

- Consider the ethical implications of the algorithm, mainly if it is used in sensitive or critical
applications.

## Slide

Prepare slides by Beamer (see templates and samples available at
https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/presentation) explaining your group’s works thoroughly.

The number of slides should not be lengthy (at most 30 slides, preferably 20-25 slides or less) and
should have adequate content for your work. All groups must give presentations with a reporting time
of no more than 45 minutes for each group, record it with your team’s faces (see an example at ?),
and submit the link together with the assignment (selected teams will have a chance to give
presentations during the two last lectures, take place in November 2024). You will be provided with
all the other groups' content before the presentation day. Based on that, each group must prepare at
least two questions and two comments/suggestions for all other groups to give the presentation on
another day.

## Other

All the meeting minutes of your group must be presented on the information pages - the first
pages of the report, and consist of the % of each member’s effort/workload on the whole (total
effort is 100%) on the first line of the minute.

Please compress all materials relating to your work as mentioned above in one .zip file, and only
the team leader submit it to the e-learning site of this course. You will have over five weeks to do
this project, ending on October 30, 2024 (hard deadline; there will be no extension.) Note that
plagiarism is strictly prohibited and will be handled accordingly.

The final exam will require some basic technical background related to this assignment. Therefore,
team members must work together so that all of you understand all aspects of the project. The team
leader should organize the team to meet this requirement.
